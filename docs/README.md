# Pinguino Documentation

_Documentation Target Version: `v0.5.2`_

This documentation is intended to be used alongside the descriptions Discord provides when you start typing a command.
Most modules are configured using the `/module` command, so reading that documentation is recommended.

It is organised into files based on how the commands are organised in the codebase.

Links to all of the documentation files can be found below.
